				<h2><b>BlockChain</b></h2>
				<div class="container">
					<p>
						<h4>
							Blockchain is a digital decentralised public ledger that is used to log transactions into ‘blocks’ in chronological order. A blockchain network is controlled by a network of devices spread across the globe. <br>
							When a transaction occurs between two parties it is recorded on the blockchain and cannot be altered without changing all the blocks that follow, which cannot be done due to the decentralised nature of blockchain. The transactions occur peer to peer, removing the requirement to involve a trusted third party. Blockchain has no centralised entry point because data is stored across the network of computers worldwide, therefore removing the risk of hacking. All the users of the network can see entries on public blockchains, if they are configured with this feature (Lo, 2017). Therefore, blockchain is tamper proof, reliable, and transparent, which can provide great benefits to the pharmaceutical industry.
							<br><b>Use Cases</b><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Verifying the Authenticity of Returned Drugs</li>
								<li>Prevention of Counterfeit Drugs and Medical Devices</li>
								<li>Compliance in Pharma supply chain</li>
								<li>Transparency and traceability of consent in Clinical Trials</li>
								<li>Improving the quality and reliability of Clinical Trials data</li>

				<h2><b>Artificial Intelligence</b></h2>
				<div class="container">
					<p>
						<h4>
							Artificial intelligence in Pharma refers to the use of automated algorithms to perform tasks which traditionally rely on human intelligence. Over the last five years, the use of artificial intelligence in the pharma and biotech industry has redefined how scientists develop new drugs, tackle disease, and more.
							<br><b>Use Cases</b><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Drug Discovery with big data analytics, <br>to model scenarios at high volumes that would not be possible using only human labour and analysis. Examples include the modelling of different types of cancer cells to work out what conditions allowed the disease to develop, and using this information to try and create new treatments.</li>
								<li>Selection of Patients for Clinical Trials<br>
								New drug clinical trials must have enough patients in order to have a big enough sample size to draw conclusions and it can often be hard for pharma companies to find patients.  AI can match specific drugs to larger databases of patients quicker than relying on people building the connections themselves.
								</li>
								<li> Automation of Pharmaceutical Reporting<br>
									Each stage of the drug discovery process must be reported on before the drug can be approved by regional authorities such as the FDA in the US or EMA in Europe.  The ability to take clinical study data and automatically generate parts of the necessary reports makes this reporting process faster and allows pharmaceutical companies to further streamline the process of getting drugs to market.<br>
									Using AI to automate pharma reports frees up medical writers’ time, allowing them to move away from data crunching reams of information and instead focus on more high value analysis and adding technical insight to reports.

				<h2><b>Cloud Services</b></h2>
				<div class="container">
					<p>
						<h4>
							A cloud service is any service made available to users on demand via the Internet from a cloud computing provider's servers as opposed to being provided from a company's own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider. <br>
							Cloud computing offers several compelling use cases for pharmaceutical companies. A cloud service can dynamically scale to meet the needs of its users, and because the service provider supplies the hardware and software necessary for the service, there’s no need for a company to provision or deploy its own resources or allocate IT staff to manage the service.  Examples of cloud services include online data storage and backup solutions, Web-based e-mail services, hosted office suites and document collaboration services, database processing, managed technical support services and more. <br>
							Applications delivered in the cloud and paid for as a subscription are enabling businesses to enjoy the benefits of enterprise solutions without having to dedicate specific resources or significant cash flow to a single tool. <br>
							Cloud technology and its use of multi-tennant app solutions are increasing the capabilities of Life Sciences solutions and reducing IT infrastructure costs through the sharing of infrastructure and investment cross-industry. <br>
							In some areas multi-tenant cloud solutions have become ubiquitous. For example, Salesforce.com claim >150K customers utilize their platform for Customer Relationship Management. Furthermore, many routinely rely on cloud services associated with their computer backups and data services associated with cell phones. <br>
							Nonetheless, the perceptions and interpretations of the regulations by which the life sciences industry must conduct its business still leave many uncertain about whether or not they can - or should - pursue the use of cloud solutions for GxP applications. <br>

							<br><b>Use Cases</b><br>
							Cloud storage is a model of computer data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools. The physical storage spans multiple servers (sometimes in multiple locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company. These cloud storage providers are responsible for keeping the data available and accessible, and the physical environment protected and running. People and organizations buy or lease storage capacity from the providers to store user, organization, or application data. <br>
							Cloud storage services may be accessed through a colocated cloud computing service, a web service application programming interface (API) or by applications that utilize the API, such as cloud desktop storage, a cloud storage gateway or Web-based content management systems.
